# Foo Bar Fight

'Foo Bar Fight' is a simplified tribute to early beat-em-ups like 'Kung Fu' on the NES.

Play as a bartender and martial artist whose bar is under siege by zombies! You can kick them a couple times to destroy the fiends and protect your booze. But being touched by monsters slowly drains your hit-points. Don't die! Take out all the creatures of the night, and drink to your health.

## Making of
This game was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all vanilla (straight, no chaser). FBF relies heavily upon grid areas. Without it the monsters wouldn't be able to move, and what fun would that be?

The background was drawn (from a unsplash stock photo) in Autodesk Skethcbook on an iPad, and then pixelated in 8Bit Photo Lab.

## MVP
The MVP includes one type of monster (zombies, naturally) which will advance on the hero and then drain his hp, and one style of attack for the hero to defend themselves. Death or victory end the game and bring a fitting message and background.

## Icebox
Nice-to-haves include more types of monsters to fight, high and low attacks for the player character, a player select, and svg animations.
