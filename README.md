# foobarfight

In 'Foo Bar Fight', you are a bartender defending his gin joint from monsters. This is a simplified tribute to early beat-em-ups like 'Kung Fu' on the NES.

This game was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all vanilla (straight, no chaser). FBF relies heavily upon grid areas. Without it the monsters wouldn't be able to move, and what fun would that be?

The MVP will include one type of monster which will advance on the hero and then drain his hp, and one attack for the hero to destroy monsters. There will be a screens to start the game, view instructions, and play the game.

Nice-to-haves include loss and vistory screens, more monsters to fight, high and low attacks for the player character, a player select, and svg animations.
