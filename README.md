# Foo Bar Fight

'Foo Bar Fight' is a simplified tribute to early beat-em-ups like 'Kung Fu' on the NES. It takes visual inspiration from early Atari and GameBoy games.

You play as a bartender and martial artist whose bar is under siege by monsters! You can kick them to destroy the fiends and protect your booze. But being touched by monsters slowly drains your hit-points. Don't die! Take out all the creatures of the night, and drink to your health.

## Gameplay
Click on the space in front of your player (the purple rectangle) to fight off the red monsters. Do it quickly, or you might die.

## Making of
This game was made using HTML, CSS, and Javascript, all vanilla (straight, no chaser). FBF relies heavily upon grid areas. Without it the monsters wouldn't be able to move, and what fun would that be?

The background was drawn (from a [unsplash stock photo](https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1583227061267-8428fb76fbfd?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&auto=format&fit=crop&w=957&q=80) by Oliver Frsh @frshmn) in Autodesk Skethcbook on an iPad, and then pixelated in 8Bit Photo Lab.

## MVP
The MVP includes one type of monster (zombies, naturally) which will advance on the hero and then drain his hp.The he can attack nearby monsters to defend themselves. Victory ends the game and bring a fitting message and background. Death, at this moment, is not final.

## Icebox
Nice-to-haves include: 
- more types of monsters to fight
- high, mid, and low attacks for the player character mapped to keys and mouse buttons
-a player select screen 
- animated attacks
- a choice between old school graphics and svg drawings
- start and pause screens
- a wider stage with monsters advancing from in front and back of the player

As a former gametester, I'd also like to fix the buggy movement of the monsters and make the loss condition permanent and predictable.
